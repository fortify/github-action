<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-sc-sast-scan.md -->

This action performs a SAST scan on ScanCentral SAST, consisting of the following steps:

* Login to ScanCentral SAST Controller
* Package application source code using ScanCentral Client
* Submit the source code package to be scanned to ScanCentral SAST Controller
* Optionally wait for the scan to complete
* Optionally export scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning dashboard

Before running this action, please ensure that the appropriate application version has been created on SSC. Future versions of this action may add support for automating application version creation.

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-login.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->

**`SSC_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify Software Security Center URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/

**`SSC_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a `CIToken`.

**`SSC_USER` & `SSC_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with SSC user credentials.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->


**`SC_SAST_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED    
Required: ScanCentral SAST Client Authentication Token for authenticating with ScanCentral SAST Controller.

**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli sc-sast session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-session-login.html).

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-login.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->

**`SSC_APPVERSION`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify SSC application version to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric application version id, or by providing application and version name in the format `<app-name>:<version-name>`. Default value is [`<github.action_repository>:<github.action_ref>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-package.md -->

**`EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
By default, this action runs `scancentral package -o package.zip` to package application source code. Based on the  automated build tool detection feature provided by ScanCentral Client, this default `scancentral` command is often sufficient. Depending on your build setup, you may however need to configure the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable to specify additional packaging options. 

As an example, if the build file that you want to use for packaging doesn't adhere  to common naming conventions, you can configure the `-bf <custom build file>` option using the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable. See [Command-line options for the package command]({{var:sc-client-doc-base-url#CLI.htm#Package}}) for more information on available options.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-package.md -->


**`SC_SAST_SENSOR_VERSION`** - REQUIRED     
Version of the ScanCentral SAST sensor on which the scan should be performed. See [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html#_options_for_scanning_a_package_file) for details.

**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST scan options; see [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.2.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

**`DO_EXPORT`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->


<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->

**`TOOL_DEFINITIONS`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify tool definitions are used by this GitHub Action to determine available versions, download location and other details of various Fortify-related tools, as required for action execution. By default, the Fortify-provided tool definitions hosted at https://github.com/fortify/tool-definitions/releases/tag/v1 will be used. 

This environment variable allows for overriding the default tool definitions, pointing to either a URL or local (workspace) file. For example, if GitHub workflows are not allowed to download tools from their public internet locations, customers may host the tool installation bundles on an internal server, together with a customized tool definitions bundle that lists the alternative download URLs.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->


### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for running a SAST scan on ScanCentral SAST.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Check out source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  
      - name: Run ScanCentral SAST Scan
        uses: fortify/github-action/sc-sast-scan@v1
        env:
          SSC_URL: ${{secrets.SSC_URL}}
          SSC_TOKEN: ${{secrets.SSC_TOKEN}}
          SC_SAST_TOKEN: ${{secrets.CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN}}
          # EXTRA_SC_SAST_LOGIN_OPTS: --socket-timeout=60s
          # SSC_APPVERSION: MyApp:MyVersion
          # EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS: -bf custom-pom.xml
          SC_SAST_SENSOR_VERSION: 23.2
          # DO_WAIT: true
          # DO_EXPORT: true
          # TOOL_DEFINITIONS: https://ftfy.mycompany.com/tool-definitions/v1/tool-definitions.yaml.zip
```
