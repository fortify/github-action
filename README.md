## fortify/github-action

The primary `fortify/github-action` action currently allows for running SAST and optional Software Composition Analysis scans on either Fortify on Demand or ScanCentral SAST / Debricked.  Which activities to perform is controlled through action inputs, the input for those activities is provided through environment variables.

Based on inputs and environment variables, this action will simply configure and run one of the following sub-actions:

| Conditions | Sub-action |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `sast-scan: true`<br>`FOD_URL` specified | [`fortify/github-action/fod-sast-scan`](#fortify-github-action-fod-sast-scan) |
| `sast-scan: true`<br>`SSC_URL` specified | [`fortify/github-action/sc-sast-scan`](#fortify-github-action-sc-sast-scan) |
| `sast-scan: false`<br>`debricked-sca-scan: true`<br>`SSC_URL` specified | [`fortify/github-action/ssc-debricked-scan`](#fortify-github-action-ssc-debricked-scan) |

If none of the conditions listed above are met, this action will complete without performing any work.


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->

### Prerequisites

This action assumes the standard software packages as provided by GitHub-hosted runners to be available. If you are using self-hosted runners, you may need to install some of these software packages in order to successfully use this action. In particular, not having the following software installed is known to cause issues when running `fortify/github-action` or one of its sub-actions:

* Node.js
* Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows-based runners only)
* Bash shell   
  If using Windows runners, this must be a Windows-based `bash` variant, for example as provided by MSYS2. You must make sure that this Windows-based `bash` variant is used for `run` steps that specify `shell: bash`. Actions will fail if the GitHub runner executes `bash` commands on the WSL-provided `bash.exe`

<!-- END-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->


Depending on inputs, additional prerequisites may apply as listed in the documentation for the sub-actions listed in the table above.

### Action inputs

**`sast-scan`** - OPTIONAL    
When set to true, the action will run a SAST scan on either Fortify on Demand (if the `FOD_URL` environment variable has been specified), or on ScanCentral SAST (if the `SSC_URL` environment variable has been specified). This includes packaging the source code, running the scan, and optionally reporting SAST scan results back into GitHub. 

If not specified or when set to false, no SAST scan will be performed. For FoD, this means that the action will complete without doing any work. For SSC, the action could still run a Debricked-only scan based on the `debricked-sca-scan` input as listed below. Future versions of this action may provide additional inputs, for example allowing you to run a dynamic application security testing (DAST) scan instead of (or in combination with) a SAST scan.

**`debricked-sca-scan`** - OPTIONAL    
(Not applicable to Fortify on Demand) When set to true, the action will run a Debricked Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scan and publish the results to Fortify SSC. You can either run a Debricked-only scan (`sast-scan` set to `false`), or both SAST and Debricked SCA scan if both inputs are set to `true`.

### Action environment variable inputs

#### Fortify on Demand


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-login.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->

**`FOD_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify on Demand URL, for example https://ams.fortify.com. Note: Using GitHub Secrets to define this URL may cause links back to FoD to be rendered incorrectly, for example in GitHub Action workflow summaries. It is highly recommended to either hard-code the URL in your workflow, or to use [GitHub Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables)  instead of GitHub Secrets. 

**`FOD_CLIENT_ID` & `FOD_CLIENT_SECRET`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with an API key: FoD Client ID (API key) and Secret (API secret).

**`FOD_TENANT`, `FOD_USER` & `FOD_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with user credentials: FoD tenant, user and password. It's recommended to use a Personal Access Token instead of an actual user password.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->


**`EXTRA_FOD_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
Extra FoD login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli fod session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-fod-session-login.html)

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-login.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->

**`FOD_RELEASE`** - OPTIONAL    
Fortify on Demand release to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric release id, `<app-name>:<release-name>` (for non-microservices applications) or `<app-name>:<microservice-name>:<release-name>` (for microservices applications). Default value is [`<github.repository>:<github.head_ref || github.ref_name>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`. Note that you'll need to explicitly configure `FOD_RELEASE` for microservices applications, as the default value lacks a microservice name.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-release.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-package.md -->

**`EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL     
By default, this action runs `scancentral package -o package.zip` to package application source code. The `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable can be used to specify additional packaging options. 

If FoD Software Composition Analysis has been purchased and configured on the applicable release, you'll need to pass the `-oss` option through this environment variable to generate and package the additional dependency files required. 

Based on the  automated build tool detection feature provided by ScanCentral Client, this default `scancentral` command is often sufficient to properly package application source code. Depending on your build setup, you may however need to configure the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable to specify additional packaging options. 

As an example, if the build file that you want to use for packaging doesn't adhere  to common naming conventions, you can configure the `-bf <custom build file>` option using the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable. See [Command-line options for the package command]({{var:sc-client-doc-base-url#CLI.htm#Package}}) for more information on available options.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-package.md -->


**`EXTRA_FOD_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra FoD SAST scan options; see [`fcli fod sast-scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-fod-sast-scan-start.html)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

**`DO_EXPORT`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository. Note that GitHub only supports importing SAST results; other results will not exported to GitHub.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->


<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-fod-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->

**`TOOL_DEFINITIONS`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify tool definitions are used by this GitHub Action to determine available versions, download location and other details of various Fortify-related tools, as required for action execution. By default, the Fortify-provided tool definitions hosted at https://github.com/fortify/tool-definitions/releases/tag/v1 will be used. 

This environment variable allows for overriding the default tool definitions, pointing to either a URL or local (workspace) file. For example, if GitHub workflows are not allowed to download tools from their public internet locations, customers may host the tool installation bundles on an internal server, together with a customized tool definitions bundle that lists the alternative download URLs.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->


#### ScanCentral SAST with optional Debricked scan


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-scan.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->

**`SSC_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify Software Security Center URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/. Note: Using GitHub Secrets to define this URL may cause links back to SSC to be rendered incorrectly, for example in GitHub Action workflow summaries. It is highly recommended to either hard-code the URL in your workflow, or to use [GitHub Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables) instead of GitHub Secrets.

**`SSC_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a `CIToken`.

**`SSC_USER` & `SSC_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with SSC user credentials.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-login.md -->

**`EXTRA_SSC_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra SSC login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli ssc session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-ssc-session-login.html).

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-login.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-login.md -->

**`SC_SAST_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED    
Required: ScanCentral SAST Client Authentication Token for authenticating with ScanCentral SAST Controller.

**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli sc-sast session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-session-login.html).

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-login.md -->


**`DO_DEBRICKED_SCAN`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will run both ScanCentral SAST and Debricked Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scans and publish both results to SSC. This is equivalent to setting the `debricked-sca-scan` input on the top-level `fortify/github-action` action. Note that this requires the [Fortify SSC Parser Plugin for Debricked results](https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-debricked-cyclonedx) to be installed on Fortify SSC, to allow for SSC to accept and process the Debricked scan results submitted by this action.

**`DEBRICKED_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED*       
Required when performing a Debricked Software Composition Analysis scan; see the [Generate access token](https://docs.debricked.com/product/administration/generate-access-token) section in the Debricked documentation for details on how to generate this token.


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->

**`SSC_APPVERSION`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify SSC application version to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric application version id, or by providing application and version name in the format `<app-name>:<version-name>`. Default value is [`<github.repository>:<github.head_ref || github.ref_name>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-package.md -->


**`SC_SAST_SENSOR_VERSION`** - REQUIRED     
Version of the ScanCentral SAST sensor on which the scan should be performed. See [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html#_options_for_scanning_a_package_file) for details.

**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST scan options; see [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-export.md -->

**`EXTRA_EXPORT_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
This environment variable allows for passing extra options to the `fcli ssc action run github-sast-report` command. Please see the `fcli ssc action help github-sast-report` command for supported options. With the current fcli version, the most interesting option is `--fs` to specify an alternative SSC filter set, for example: `EXTRA_EXPORT_OPTS: --fs "Quick View"`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-export.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

#### Debricked-only scan and publish to SSC


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-debricked-scan.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->

**`SSC_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify Software Security Center URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/. Note: Using GitHub Secrets to define this URL may cause links back to SSC to be rendered incorrectly, for example in GitHub Action workflow summaries.

### Action inputs

**`export-path`** - OPTIONAL    
Whether to add the installed tools to the system PATH variable. Allowed values: `true` (default) or `false`

**`tool-definitions`** - OPTIONAL
Allows for overriding the location of the Fortify tool definitions bundle. This can be specified either as an action input or through the `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` environment variable; see the 'Action environment variable inputs' section below for details.

**`fcli`** - OPTIONAL    
The fcli version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install fcli), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.0` and `2.0.0` are semantically the same.

**`sc-client`** - OPTIONAL    
The ScanCentral Client version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `23.1` will install the latest known `23.1.y` patch version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v23.1` and `23.1` are semantically the same.

**`fod-uploader`** - OPTIONAL    
The FoDUploader version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v5` will install the latest known `5.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v5.4.0` and `5.4.0` are semantically the same.

**`vuln-exporter`** - OPTIONAL    
The FortifyVulnerabilityExporter version to install. Allowed values: `skip` (default value, do not install), `latest`, or specific version number. Supports semantic versioning, for example `v2` will install the latest known `2.x.y` version. Version may be specified either with or without the `v` prefix, for example `v2.0.4` and `2.0.4` are semantically the same.

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->

**`TOOL_DEFINITIONS`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify tool definitions are used by this GitHub Action to determine available versions, download location and other details of various Fortify-related tools, as required for action execution. By default, the Fortify-provided tool definitions hosted at https://github.com/fortify/tool-definitions/releases/tag/v1 will be used. 

This environment variable allows for overriding the default tool definitions, pointing to either a URL or local (workspace) file. For example, if GitHub workflows are not allowed to download tools from their public internet locations, customers may host the tool installation bundles on an internal server, together with a customized tool definitions bundle that lists the alternative download URLs.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->


### Action outputs

For each tool being installed, the action outputs several environment variables for use by later workflow steps.

**`PATH`**    
If the `export-path` action input was set to `true` (default), the bin-directory of the installed tool will be added to the workflow `PATH` environment variable.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_INSTALL_DIR`**    
Directory where the corresponding tool was installed. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_INSTALL_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_BIN_DIR`**    
Bin-directory that holds the executables for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_BIN_DIR`.

**`<TOOL_NAME>_CMD`**    
Fully qualified path to the (primary) executable/script for the corresponding tool. `<TOOL_NAME>` corresponds to the various action inputs, but converted to uppercase and dashes replaced by underscore, for example `FOD_UPLOADER_CMD`.

### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for installing the various Fortify tools and how to run these tools. Some notes:

* The `export-path` and `bugtracker-utility` inputs are set to their default values, and thus could have been omitted.
* The action supports semantic versioning, so the `vuln-exporter` input will install the latest known v2.x.y version of FortifyVulnerabilityExporter.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Setup Fortify tools
        uses: fortify/github-action/setup@v1
        with:
          tool-definitions: https://github.com/fortify/tool-definitions/releases/download/v1/tool-definitions.yaml.zip
          export-path: true
          fcli: latest

<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->

### Prerequisites

This action assumes the standard software packages as provided by GitHub-hosted runners to be available. If you are using self-hosted runners, you may need to install some of these software packages in order to successfully use this action. In particular, not having the following software installed is known to cause issues when running `fortify/github-action` or one of its sub-actions:

* Node.js
* Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows-based runners only)
* Bash shell   
  If using Windows runners, this must be a Windows-based `bash` variant, for example as provided by MSYS2. You must make sure that this Windows-based `bash` variant is used for `run` steps that specify `shell: bash`.

<a name="fortify-github-action-fod-sast-scan"></a>

## fortify/github-action/fod-sast-scan


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-fod-sast-scan.md -->

This action performs a SAST scan on Fortify on Demand (FoD). If software composition analysis of open source has been purchased and configured on the applicable release, this action can be used to perform a combined SAST and SCA (open source) scan. 

The SAST and optional open source scan performed by this action consists of the following steps:

* Login to FoD
* Package application source code using ScanCentral Client
* Submit the source code package to be scanned to FoD
* Optionally wait for the scan to complete
* Optionally export scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning dashboard


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->

### Prerequisites

This action assumes the standard software packages as provided by GitHub-hosted runners to be available. If you are using self-hosted runners, you may need to install some of these software packages in order to successfully use this action. In particular, not having the following software installed is known to cause issues when running `fortify/github-action` or one of its sub-actions:

* Node.js
* Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows-based runners only)
* Bash shell   
  If using Windows runners, this must be a Windows-based `bash` variant, for example as provided by MSYS2. You must make sure that this Windows-based `bash` variant is used for `run` steps that specify `shell: bash`. Actions will fail if the GitHub runner executes `bash` commands on the WSL-provided `bash.exe`

<!-- END-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->


Apart from the generic action prerequisites listed above, the following prerequisites apply to this specific action:

* The appropriate application release exists on FoD and has been configured for SAST scans. Future versions of this action may add support for automating app/release creation and scan setup.
* If open source scanning has been enabled in the FoD SAST scan configuration, be sure to pass the `-oss` option through the `EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS` environment variable.

<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-fod-connection.md -->

**`FOD_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify on Demand URL, for example https://ams.fortify.com. Note: Using GitHub Secrets to define this URL may cause links back to FoD to be rendered incorrectly, for example in GitHub Action workflow summaries. It is highly recommended to either hard-code the URL in your workflow, or to use [GitHub Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables)  instead of GitHub Secrets. 

**`FOD_CLIENT_ID` & `FOD_CLIENT_SECRET`** - REQUIRED*    
Required when authenticating with an API key: FoD Client ID (API key) and Secret (API secret).

**`FOD_TENANT`, `FOD_USER` & `FOD_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*

Version of the ScanCentral SAST sensor on which the scan should be performed. See [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html#_options_for_scanning_a_package_file) for details.

**`EXTRA_SC_SAST_SCAN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra ScanCentral SAST scan options; see [`fcli sc-sast scan start` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-sc-sast-scan-start.html)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-export.md -->

**`EXTRA_EXPORT_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL   
This environment variable allows for passing extra options to the `fcli ssc action run github-sast-report` command. Please see the `fcli ssc action help github-sast-report` command for supported options. With the current fcli version, the most interesting option is `--fs` to specify an alternative SSC filter set, for example: `EXTRA_EXPORT_OPTS: --fs "Quick View"`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-export.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->

**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will not wait until the scan has been completed. To have the workflow wait until the scan has been completed, set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`. Note that `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`; see below.

**`DO_EXPORT`** - OPTIONAL    
If set to `true`, this action will export scan results to the GitHub Security Code Scanning dashboard. Note that this may require a [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) subscription, unless you're running this action on a public github.com repository. Note that GitHub only supports importing SAST results; other results will not exported to GitHub.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-wait-export.md -->


<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-sc-sast-scan.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->

**`TOOL_DEFINITIONS`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify tool definitions are used by this GitHub Action to determine available versions, download location and other details of various Fortify-related tools, as required for action execution. By default, the Fortify-provided tool definitions hosted at https://github.com/fortify/tool-definitions/releases/tag/v1 will be used. 

This environment variable allows for overriding the default tool definitions, pointing to either a URL or local (workspace) file. For example, if GitHub workflows are not allowed to download tools from their public internet locations, customers may host the tool installation bundles on an internal server, together with a customized tool definitions bundle that lists the alternative download URLs.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-setup.md -->


### Sample usage

The sample workflow below demonstrates how to configure the action for running a SAST scan on ScanCentral SAST.

```yaml
    steps:    
      - name: Check out source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  
      - name: Run ScanCentral SAST Scan
        uses: fortify/github-action/sc-sast-scan@v1
        env:
          SSC_URL: ${{vars.SSC_URL}}
          SSC_TOKEN: ${{secrets.SSC_TOKEN}}
          # EXTRA_SSC_LOGIN_OPTS: --socket-timeout=60s
          SC_SAST_TOKEN: ${{secrets.CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN}}
          # EXTRA_SC_SAST_LOGIN_OPTS: --socket-timeout=60s
          # SSC_APPVERSION: MyApp:MyVersion
          # EXTRA_PACKAGE_OPTS: -bf custom-pom.xml
          SC_SAST_SENSOR_VERSION: 23.2
          # DO_DEBRICKED_SCAN: true  # Or debricked-sca-scan input on top-level action
          # DEBRICKED_TOKEN: ${{secrets.DEBRICKED_TOKEN}}
          # DO_WAIT: true
          # DO_EXPORT: true
          # TOOL_DEFINITIONS: https://ftfy.mycompany.com/tool-definitions/v1/tool-definitions.yaml.zip
```

## fortify/github-action/ssc-debricked-scan


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-ssc-debricked-scan.md -->

This action performs a Debricked Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scan, consisting of the following steps:

* Login to Fortify SSC
* Run Debricked scan
* Publish Debricked scan results to Fortify SSC
* Optionally wait for SSC artifact processing to complete

Note that this action is explicitly meant for Debricked/SSC integration. If you wish to run a Debricked scan without publishing the results to SSC, please see the [Debricked GitHub Integration documentation](https://portal.debricked.com/integrations-48/integration-with-github-214#github-actions)


<!-- START-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->

### Prerequisites

This action assumes the standard software packages as provided by GitHub-hosted runners to be available. If you are using self-hosted runners, you may need to install some of these software packages in order to successfully use this action. In particular, not having the following software installed is known to cause issues when running `fortify/github-action` or one of its sub-actions:

* Node.js
* Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows-based runners only)
* Bash shell   
  If using Windows runners, this must be a Windows-based `bash` variant, for example as provided by MSYS2. You must make sure that this Windows-based `bash` variant is used for `run` steps that specify `shell: bash`. Actions will fail if the GitHub runner executes `bash` commands on the WSL-provided `bash.exe`

<!-- END-INCLUDE:action-prerequisites.md -->


Apart from the generic action prerequisites listed above, the following prerequisites apply to this specific action:

* The appropriate application version must exist on SSC. Future versions of this action may add support for automating application version creation.
* The [Fortify SSC Parser Plugin for Debricked results](https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-debricked-cyclonedx) must be installed on Fortify SSC, to allow for SSC to accept and process the Debricked scan results submitted by this action.

### Action environment variable inputs


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-debricked-scan.md -->


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->

**`SSC_URL`** - REQUIRED   
Fortify Software Security Center URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/. Note: Using GitHub Secrets to define this URL may cause links back to SSC to be rendered incorrectly, for example in GitHub Action workflow summaries. It is highly recommended to either hard-code the URL in your workflow, or to use [GitHub Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables) instead of GitHub Secrets.

**`SSC_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a `CIToken`.

**`SSC_USER` & `SSC_PASSWORD`** - REQUIRED*   
Required when authenticating with SSC user credentials.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-connection.md -->



<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-login.md -->

**`EXTRA_SSC_LOGIN_OPTS`** - OPTIONAL    
Extra SSC login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see [`fcli ssc session login` documentation](https://fortify.github.io/fcli/v2.3.0//manpage/fcli-ssc-session-login.html).

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-login.md -->


**`DEBRICKED_TOKEN`** - REQUIRED          
See the [Generate access token](https://docs.debricked.com/product/administration/generate-access-token) section in the Debricked documentation for details on how to generate this token.


<!-- START-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->

**`SSC_APPVERSION`** - OPTIONAL   
Fortify SSC application version to use with this action. This can be specified either as a numeric application version id, or by providing application and version name in the format `<app-name>:<version-name>`. Default value is [`<github.repository>:<github.head_ref || github.ref_name>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-appversion.md -->


**`DO_WAIT`** - OPTIONAL    
By default, this action will complete immediately after Debricked scan results have been uploaded to SSC. To have the workflow wait until the Debricked results have been processed by SSC (potentially failing if the results cannot be successfully processed), set the `DO_WAIT` environment variable to `true`.

For consistency with other actions, `DO_WAIT` is implied if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`, but since GitHub doesn't support importing Software Composition Analysis results, Debricked results will not be published to GitHub even if `DO_EXPORT` is set to `true`.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:env-ssc-debricked-scan.md -->
